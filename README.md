# MLfromScratch
Implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms from scratch using foundational libraries like NumPy.


Can run files using

```python -m test.module_name.model_name```

module_name : linear_models, neighbors

model_name : LinearRegression, KNNClassifier

All Regression tests will be performed on Boston Housing dataset

All Classification tests will be performed on Iris Species dataset
